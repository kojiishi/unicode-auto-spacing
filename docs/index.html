<h1>EAST ASIAN AUTO SPACING (Proposal)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">1 Overview and Scope</h2>
<p>
East Asian text usually consists of multiple scripts, such as Han ideographs,
Kana syllables, and Hangul syllables, along with Latin letters and numeric
characters.
Their established typography conventions define that
a thin spacing between East Asian scripts and other scripts
improves the readability.
This spacing should be represented by
adjusting glyph spacings similar to kerning,
rather than by using space characters.
</p><p>
While detailed rules of the spacing can vary across documents, it is important
that the choice made by an author for a specific document be clearly
established, so that a rendering system can display what the author intended.
It is also important that this choice be established independently of the font
resources, as the rendering systems may have to use other fonts than those
intended or specified in the document. Finally, the expression of the author’s
choice should be relatively concise, to facilitate document authoring and
minimize document size.
</p><p>
This report describes a Unicode character property which can serve as a stable
default rule of inserting the spacing for the purpose of reliable document
interchange.
</p><p>
For the purpose of reliable document interchange, this property defines an
unambiguous default value, so that implementations could reliably render a
character stream based solely on the property values, without depending on other
information such as provided in the tables of the selected font.
</p><p>
The intent is that the author should be able to specify where they want to
override, and that in the absence of an explicit specification, the spacing is
implicitly that defined by the property presented in this report.
</p><p>
The actual choice for the property values should result in a reasonable or
legible default, but it may not be publishing-material quality, and it may not
be a good choice if used in a specific style or context.
</p><p>
The property values are chosen first to match existing practice in East Asian
contexts in their respective environments. For characters that are not generally
used in such environments, similarity to existing characters has been taken into
consideration. It also takes East Asian characters in non-East Asian texts into
account.
</p>
<h2>2 Conformance</h2>
<p>
The property defined in this report is informative. The intent of this report is
to provide, in the absence of other information, a reasonable way to determine
the correct automatic spacing, but this behavior can be overridden by inserting
space characters, or by a higher-level protocol, such as through markup or by
the preferences of a layout application. This default determination is defined
in the accompanying data file <a href="#data">Data</a>,
but in no way implies that the spacing is
inserted only by this rule.
</p><p>
For more information on the conformance implications, see
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/">Unicode</a>,
Section 3.5, Properties,
in particular the definition (D35) of an informative property.
</p>
<h2>3 The Auto_Spacing Property (as)</h2>

<h3>3.1 Property Values</h3>
<p>
The possible property values are given in Table 1.
</p>
<table id="values" class="simple">
  <caption>Table 1. Property Values</caption>
  <tr class="heading"><th>Value</th><th>Description</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <th>W</th>
    <td>
      Characters that are considered as East Asian script
      for the auto-spacing purpose.
    </td>
    <td>Han ideographic characters and Kana syllables are examples of this value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>N</th>
    <td>Characters that need the auto-spacing with adjacent “W” characters.</td>
    <td>Latin letters and digits are examples of this value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>O</th>
    <td>Characters that don’t need the auto-spacing.</td>
    <td>
      Most symbols and punctuation characters
      such as COMMA and FULL STOP are examples of this value.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>C</th>
    <td>Characters that are “N” for Chinese and “O” for other languages.</td>
    <td>
      Characters that can appear as prefix or suffix of Latin letters or digits,
      such as U+0025 PERCENT SIGN.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Characters that have the property value “N” are
similar to the “Narrow” characters in
<a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr11/">UAX#11 EAST ASIAN WIDTH</a>,
but most punctuation characters and symbols are excluded.
Similarly, characters that have the property value “W” are similar to
the “Wide” characters, but most punctuation characters and symbols are excluded.
Also, to follow the existing practice, Hangul characters, circled characters,
square characters, and Emoji are defined as “O”.
</p><p>
The value “C” stands for “conditional”.
Please see
<a href="#symbols-punctuation">3.2.3 Symbols and Punctuation Characters</a>
for more details.
</p>
<h3>3.2 Spacing Algorithm</h3>
<p>
The auto-spacing should be inserted between “W” and “N”, and between “N” and “W”,
after resolving the conditional value “C” to “N” or “O”.
</p><p>
The exact amount of the spacing can vary across documents. This property doesn’t
define the exact amount. Instead, it should be defined by high-level protocols
or applications such as through markup or by the preferences of a layout
application.
</p><p>
There are two ways to represent a space:
a character space (by the insertion of physical code points),
or in a glyph space (similar to kerning,
adjusting the metrics of adjacent glyphs on the device).
A glyph space is recommended
for high-level protocols or applications that can represent glyph spaces.
</p>
<h3>3.3 Scope of the Property</h3>

<h4>3.3.1 Grapheme Cluster</h4>
<p>
As in all matters of typography, the interesting unit of text is not the
character, but a grapheme cluster: it does not make sense to insert the auto
spacing between a base character and a combining mark attached to it.
Implementations should insert the auto-spacing before or after each grapheme
cluster.
</p><p>
A possible choice for the notion of grapheme cluster is either that of legacy
grapheme cluster or that of extended grapheme cluster, as defined in
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/">UAX#29</a>.
</p><p>
The property value for a grapheme cluster as a whole is then determined by
taking the property value of the first character in the cluster, with the
following exception:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the cluster contains an enclosing combining mark (general category Me),
    then the whole cluster has the Auto_Spacing property value “O”.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="space-char">3.3.2 Space Characters</h4>
<p>
The property values for space characters (General Category Zs) are “O”.
This is to avoid inserting the auto-spacing around space characters,
which can lead to undesirable double spacing.
</p><p>
It also allows authors to override the algorithm
when high-level protocols or applications don’t provide a way
for authors to express their intent to override this algorithm,
such as plain text files.
</p><p>
U+0020 SPACE indicates a semantic boundary,
which is stronger than the spacing for the readability.
Using the code point for the auto-spacing purpose
can make distinguishing semantic boundaries
from the spacing for the readability difficult,
and therefore it’s discouraged.
</p><p>
U+2006 SIX-PER-EM SPACE should usually represent a thin space,
which is suitable to represent the auto-spacing for the readability.
Inserting the code point
to where the algorithm doesn’t insert the auto-spacing
should indicate that the auto-spacing is desired there.
</p><p>
Likewise, inserting U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE
to where the algorithm inserts the auto-spacing
should prevent the auto-spacing from being inserted by rendering systems.
</p>
<h4 id="symbols-punctuation">3.3.3 Symbols and Punctuation Characters</h4>
<p>
In some existing practices,
symbols and punctuation characters insert the spacing,
while they don’t in other existing practices.
</p><p>
For example, when one side of a word is a letter or a digit
and the other side is a punctuation character,
such as “20%”, “$20”, or “C#”,
and they appear adjacent to “W” characters,
some existing practices
prefer inserting the spacing to both sides of them,
considering that not doing so look unbalanced.
</p><p>
On the other hand, traditional printing typography often considers
such unbalanced spacing as good results,
from the perspective that
the spacing is to prevent characters from being too close together,
not to highlight words as parentheses do.
</p><p>
The conditional value “C” is assigned to such characters.
Chinese content often prefers the spacing in such cases,
and thus they should resolve “C” to “N”,
while other content should resolve “C” to “O”.
</p><p>
If the author is uncertain
whether their content is used in Chinese context or not,
and they want to express their intentions,
they can override the algorithm as described in
<a href="#space-char">3.3.2 Space Characters</a>.
</p>
<h4>3.3.4 Vertical Text Layout</h4>
<p>
In vertical text layout, a character may be displayed upright or sideways
rotated, as defined in <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr50/">UAX#50</a>.
</p><p>
If a character that has the Auto_Spacing property value “N” is displayed upright,
the rendering system should handle it
as if it has the property value “O” instead.
</p>
<h4>3.3.5 Right-to-Left Scripts</h4>
<p>
This property has a current limitation in that the handling of right-to-left
scripts is not specified. This includes scripts that are predominantly written
right to left, such as Arabic, along with right-to-left scripts that are meant
to be written vertically, such as Chorasmian.
</p>
<h2 id="data">4 Data File</h2>
<p>
This property is derived by the following algorithm:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Assign the property value “W” if it’s in the following set:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Include if the Script property is one of the following values:
        <ul class="inline">
          <li>Bopomofo (Bopo)</li>
          <li>Han (Hani)</li>
          <li>Hiragana (Hira)</li>
          <li>Katakana (Kana)</li>
          <li>Khitan_Small_Script (Kits)</li>
          <li>Nushu (Nshu)</li>
          <li>Tangut (Tang)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Include if the Script_Extensions property is one of the values above,
        except when the East_Asian_Width property is “N” or “Na”.
      </li>
      <li>Exclude if the East_Asian_Width property is “H”.</li>
      <li>Exclude if the General_Category property is “P” or “No”.</li>
      <li>Exclude if the General_Category property is “S” except “Sk”.</li>
      <li>Include the following code point:
        <ul class="inline">
          <li>U+3013 GETA MARK</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise, assign the property value “C” if it’s in the following set:
    <ul>
      <li>Include if the General_Category property is “Po”.</li>
      <li>Exclude if the East_Asian_Width property is “F”, “H”, or “W”.</li>
      <li>Exclude the following code points:
        <ul class="inline">
          <li>U+0022 QUOTATION MARK</li>
          <li>U+0027 APOSTROPHE</li>
          <li>U+002A ASTERISK</li>
          <li>U+002F SOLIDUS</li>
          <li>U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT</li>
          <li>U+2020 DAGGER</li>
          <li>U+2021 DOUBLE DAGGER</li>
          <li>U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise, assign the property value “N” if it’s in the following set:
    <ol>
      <li>Include if the General_Category property is “L”, “M”, or “Nd”.</li>
      <li>Exclude if the East_Asian_Width property is “F, “H”, or “W”.</li>
      <li>Exclude if the Script property is “Hangul”.</li>
      <li>Exclude if the Script_Extensions property is “Hang”.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise, assign the property value “O”.</li>
